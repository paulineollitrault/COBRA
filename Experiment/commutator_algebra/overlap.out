The overlap matrix requires computing commutators:
Between 1-body operators -- ADJ NOR
operator number  2
hs[0][i,j] = 1 * delta(a,b) 
hs[0][b,a] = -1 * delta(j,i) 
===========
Between 1-body operators -- ADJ ADJ
operator number  0
===========
Between 1-body and 2-body operators -- ADJ NOR
operator number  4
hs[1][c,i,j,k] = 1 * delta(a,b) 
hs[1][b,i,j,k] = 1 * delta(a,c) 
hs[1][b,c,a,j] = -1 * delta(k,i) 
hs[1][b,c,a,k] = -1 * delta(j,i) 
===========
